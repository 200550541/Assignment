        <p>
            I'm findin' ways to articulate the feeling I'm goin' through
            I just can't say I don't love you
            'Cause I love you, yeah
            It's hard for me to communicate the thoughts that I hold
            But tonight, I'm gon' let you know
            Let me tell the truth
            Baby, let me tell the truth, yeah<br /> </p>

        <p>  You know what I'm thinkin', see it in your eyes
            You hate that you want me, hate it when you cry
            You're scared to be lonely, especially in the night
            I'm scared that I'll miss you, happens every time
            I don't want this feelin', I can't afford love
            I try to find a reason to pull us apart
            It ain't workin' 'cause you're perfect
            And I know that you're worth it
            I can't walk away, (oh)<br /></p>

          <p>Even though we're going through it
            And it makes you feel alone
            Just know that I would die for you
            Baby, I would die for you, yeah
            The distance and the time between us
            It'll never change my mind
            'Cause baby, I would die for you
            Baby, I would die for you, yeah
          <br /></p>

        <p>  I'm finding ways to manipulate the feelin' you're going through
            But baby-girl, I'm not blaming you
            Just don't blame me too, yeah
            'Cause I can't take this pain forever
            And you won't find no one that's better
            'Cause I'm right for you, babe
            I think I'm right for you, babe<br /></p>

         <p> You know what I'm thinking, see it in your eyes
            You hate that you want me, hate it when you cry
            It ain't workin' 'cause you're perfect
            And I know that you're worth it
            I can't walk away<br /></p>

         <p> Even though we're going through it
            And it makes you feel alone
            Just know that I would die for you
            Baby, I would die for you, yeah
            The distance and the time between us
            It'll never change my mind
            'Cause baby, I would die for you
            Baby, I would die for you, yeah <br /></p>

         <p> I would die for you, I would lie for you
            Keep it real with you, I would kill for you, my baby
            I'm just sayin', yeah
            I would die for you, I would lie for you
            Keep it real with you, I would kill for you, my baby
            Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na<br /></p>

         <p> Even though we're going through it
            And it makes you feel alone
            Just know that I would die for you
            Baby, I would die for you, yeah
            The distance and the time between us
            It'll never change my mind
            'Cause baby, I would die for you
            Baby, I would die for you, yeah
            Die for you<br /></p>
